2. Show all the output from running the code below

	num = 3

	def func1(var1):
		print "in func 1 var1: " + str(var1)
		print "type: " + str(type(var1))
		print "divide: " + str(var1 / num)
		list = []
		for i in range(int(var1)):
			list.append(i)
		return list

	def main():
		func1(3)
		print func1(3.0)
		func1(5)
		print len(func1(2))
		t = func1(2)
		print type(t)
		print func1(0)

	main()


5. Give the output of the following code. If you think there is an exception
at any point, just write the word EXCEPTION (don't worry about the details of
the exception):

	dict = {"a": 1, 1: "a"}
	print dict["a"]
	print dict[1]
	dict["a"] = 2
	dict["b"] = 3
	print dict["a"]
	print dict["b"]
	print dict["c"]


6. Give the output for the following code:

	def divide(x="2", y="3"):
		try:
			print "x " + x
			print "y " + str(y)
			div = int(x) / y
			print div
		except (ZeroDivisionError), e:
			print "cannot divide by zero!"
			raise(ValueError(e))
		except(Exception), e:
			print "something went wrong!"
		else:
			print "well done"

	def main():
		try:
			print "in main"
			divide()
			divide(y=2)
			divide("7")
			print "halfway done divide"
			divide("1", 1)
			divide("1", 0)
			print "done all divisions"
		exception(ValueError), e:
			print "no"
		except (Exception), e:
			print "fail"
		finally:
			print "glad that's over"

	main()


7. Short answer

	a. Write an expression to open a file  called best.html for reading (it's
	in the current directory), and then print out the entire contents of the
	file.

	b. Write an expression to update the list[2, "kinga", (1, 2)] to contain
	"king" instead of "kinga", or state why this is impossible.

	c. Now write an expression to update the tuple (2, "kinga", (1, 2)) to
	contain "kinga" instead of "kinga", or wtate why this is impossible.

	d. What is the output of the following code?

		def test():
			print "yes"

		print test()

	e. What is the output of the following code?

		list1 = [1, 2, 3]
		list2 = [list1, 2, 3]
		print list2
		list1.append(4)
		print list2
		print list1

	f. Give the output of the following code:
		print (True or False)
		print (True and False)
		print (1==1 and 1!= 1)

	g. Describe one thing you liked or found useful this semester, and one
	thing you did not like or did not find useful this semester.
