1. Imagine you are working on a team to implement a database for storing
information about types of animals. Answer the following questions:

	a. Write a class called Animal, stored in a file called animal.py, that
	has the following properties
		i. Each animal has a color, weight, age, and species.
		ii. A constructor that takes as argument three of the attributes above
		(no more than three). It initializes those to the incoming values. The
		fourth argument should be initialized inside the constructor to
		whatever value you want.
		iii. ALL of the fields must ALWAYS be of type String, for the lifetime
		of the object.
		iv. A to-string method that can be called with a print  statement,
		which would show the color and weight.
		v. A method that returns the age of the animal.
		vi. A method to set the age of the animal.

	b. Now write a module, saved as driver.py, to create two Animal objects
	below (you can assign them any reasonable values). Set the age of the
	first animal to 15, and the age of the second animal to 1. There should be
	no errors when I run the module as python driver.py, assuming your Animal
	class and this file are in the same directory.


3. Write a function below called find, that calculates the number of times the
character 'c' occurs in the elements of an incoming list (you may assume they
will always be strings), without using any built-in functions/methods. The
function should take a single list argument, and return an integer. Your
function must not assume anything about the size of the incoming list, i.e.,
it could be empty.

For example: find(["cat", "cuckoo", "dog"]) would return 3.


4. Write a function called oddSum that takes as argument a non-empty list of
integers and prints out the sum of every other integer in the list without
using any built-in functions/methods.

For example, oddSum([1, 4, 2, 4 ]) prints out 8.
