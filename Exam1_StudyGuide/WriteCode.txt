2. Write python code below that prompts the user to enter a character with the
prompt "Enter char: ".
Then, decide whether the character's integer value is greater than or less than 64.
If it is less than 64, print out "SMALL" followed by the integer value of the character.
If it's greater than or equal to 100, print out "LARGE", followed by the integer value of the character.
Otherwise, print out "MEDIUM".
